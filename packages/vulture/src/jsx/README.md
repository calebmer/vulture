# Vulture JSX
This module is responsible for operations on JSX.

JSX is an XML-like extension to ECMAScript authored by [Facebook](http://facebook.github.io/jsx/). It allows developers to use the full expressiveness of JavaScript when constructing their HTML or similar UI markup. In addition having JSX transpile to plain old JavaScript objects gives framework authors extreme flexibility in how the ultimately render their UI.
